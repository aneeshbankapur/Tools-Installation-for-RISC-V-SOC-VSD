# SoC / ASIC Design Flow

This document explains the typical design flow for a **System on a Chip (SoC)** or **Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)**.  
It shows how a high-level concept is transformed into a **physical chip ready for manufacturing**.

## ðŸ“Œ Stage 1: Chip Modelling & Specification (O1)

**Goal:** Define what the chip should do (conceptual phase).

- **Specs (C Model):**  
  Start with a high-level functional model, usually written in **C/C++**.  
  This model defines the required functionality and serves as the **golden reference**.

- **C-language Testbench:**  
  A test environment is created in **C** to validate the C model against the specifications.  
  Ensures initial requirements are correct and achievable.

## ðŸ“Œ Stage 2: RTL Architecture & Design (O2)

**Goal:** Translate the abstract specification into hardware description.

- **RTL Design:**  
  Engineers describe the hardware at **Register-Transfer Level (RTL)** using **Verilog** or **VHDL**.  
  This RTL code acts as the **blueprint** of the hardware.

- **SoC Verification:**  
  RTL is continuously simulated and compared against the **C model output** (indicated by the green loop in diagrams).  
  Ensures the hardware faithfully matches the original specification.

## ðŸ“Œ Stage 3: Synthesis & SoC Integration (O3)

**Goal:** Convert RTL into a gate-level representation and assemble components.

- **Synthesis:**  
  RTL code â†’ **Gate-Level Netlist** using **EDA tools**.  
  The netlist describes the design in terms of logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, etc.).

- **Component Integration:**  
  Modern SoCs integrate multiple components:
  - **Processor**: Core CPU (ARM, RISC-V, etc.) â€“ usually provided as synthesizable RTL.
  - **Peripherals/IPs**: Standard IP blocks (USB, PCIe, Memory Controller).
  - **Macros**: Custom synthesized blocks.
  - **Analog IPs**: Pre-designed analog blocks (PLLs, ADCs). Provided as **Hard Macros (fixed layout)** with functional RTL models.

- **SoC Integration:**  
  Combine digital netlists + analog blocks â†’ **Top-level SoC Netlist**.

## ðŸ“Œ Stage 4: Physical Design (RTL â†’ GDS)

**Goal:** Convert logical design into a **physical silicon layout**.

- **Floorplanning:** High-level placement of major blocks on the chip.  
- **Placement:** Precise location of every logic gate.  
- **Routing:** Drawing interconnects (metal wires) between gates/blocks.  

- **Hard vs Soft Macros:**  
  - **Hard Macros (HM):** Pre-defined physical layout (e.g., Analog IPs).  
  - **Soft Macros/Soft Logic:** Synthesized from RTL (e.g., CPU core).  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Stage 5: Sign-off & Tape-out(O4)

**Goal:** Final verification before chip manufacturing.

- **GDSII:** Final file format containing the exact **geometric layout** for fabrication.  
- **Checks:**
  - **DRC (Design Rule Check):** Ensures layout follows foundry rules (wire width, spacing, etc.).  
  - **LVS (Layout vs. Schematic):** Confirms layout matches the netlist (electrical correctness).  

- **Tape-out:**  
  Once all checks pass, the **GDSII** file is sent to the foundry â†’ **chip fabrication begins**.
